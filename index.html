<h2>Knock'em</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A casual game of bouncing a ball.
</li>

The player will experience no stress but pure fun.
</li>
a
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A casual game such as Canday Crush, but far less complex.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The object of the game is simple. The player will be in control of a knocker object. The knocker will bounce the ball object against the boundaries of the world. With each bounce the ball will accelerate. The player must bounce the ball with the knocker as many times as they can. They keep going until the time is up.

The physics of the bouncing and the time mechanic.
</li>

Real physics with the ball bouncing and acceleration.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is a clear color background. No special or artistic work here. The story you knocking a ball as many times as you can.

<li><strong>Story:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is for casual players, not real hardcore players.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game is only a minute long, but can get pretty intense as the ball gets faster with every bounce.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Strategies that will help the player is watching the angle of the ball movement, and letting the ball come to them. Instead of chasing it.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
My asset was the phaser used from the demo.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed from the Phaser and "Bounce Knock" examples for my game.
